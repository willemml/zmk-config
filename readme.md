# willem's zmk-config

This is my personal [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/)
configuration, based in decent amounts on the works of
[urob](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config),
[kdb424](https://github.com/kdb424/sweep-zmk), and
[klardotsh](https://github.com/klardotsh/zmk-config).
It powers my "smol boards" like
[Sam Mohr's Osprette](https://sammohr.dev/keyboards).
